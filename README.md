Custom AI URL as far as i am aware, only ChatGPT supports it,
but i still added it nonetheless for futureproofing. 


For anki, you need to have the app installed and running, 
and to have the AnkiConnect addon installed.
If the port used is not the default, you'll have to change it manually
(in the "background.js" file, line 96).

I truly hope some one finds this extension helpful, even if for an insignificant amount!
